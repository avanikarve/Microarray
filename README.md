## Project: Brain Cancer Gene Expression Analysis

### Objective  
This academic project aims to identify potential biomarkers for brain cancer by analyzing gene expression data. The goal is to find a set of differentially expressed genes and build a basic classification rule that can help determine whether an individual is susceptible to one of the four types of brain cancer based on their gene expression values.

### Dataset  
The dataset contains gene expression values for 54,625 genes across 130 individuals. The samples include five groups: Ependymoma, Glioblastoma, Medulloblastoma, Pilocytic Astrocytoma, and Normal.  
The original dataset was taken from https://sbcb.inf.ufrgs.br/cumida (#), and I cleaned it to structure it in the format required for the analysis.
